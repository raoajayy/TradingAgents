"""The Pro agent roster: 59 evidence agents as configuration (ADR-0014).

Executive roles are deliberately absent — they synthesize evidence rather
than emit it, and become graph nodes in Phase 4 (their charters live in
prompts/executive_team.md).

Specs may select inputs that today's feeds don't provide (ADX, VWAP,
Supertrend; X/Twitter items). Those agents abstain at runtime until the
input exists — an honest gap, never a fabricated opinion. Each such spec
carries a ``notes`` entry naming the missing dependency.
