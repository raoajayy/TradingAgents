"""Dead-man switch — layer (c) of the three-layer kill switch (Phase 5).

Layers (a) automated risk triggers and (b) the manual/file kill switch
already exist. This is the third: if the system can't confirm its own
health for ``timeout_seconds``, assume the operator is blind and the loop
may be wedged, and **cancel all resting orders** so nothing keeps working
unattended. Per the spec it does NOT flatten open positions — those keep
their venue-side protective stops; it removes only the un-triggered
resting orders that could fire while no one is watching.

Same lifecycle as ``BracketWatchdog``/``LossLimitMonitor``: a daemon
thread, or ``tick(now)`` synchronously in tests. Only started when a pair
is live-armed.
