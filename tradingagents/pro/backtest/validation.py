"""Overfitting-aware validation (roadmap P2 / architecture track T3).

The differentiator identified in the framework survey (docs/research/
05_gap_analysis.md): no surveyed backtester ships these guards, and our KB's
central lesson (docs/research/03_institutional_best_practices.md) is that
every blow-up was a validation/risk failure. These are pure functions —
deterministic and dependency-light — so the optimizer (optimize.py) can
report, for any selected result, the probability it is spurious.

Single source of truth: the PSR and E[max SR] cores live in
``tradingagents.pro.analytics.validation`` (``psr`` /
``expected_max_sharpe``); this module keeps its trial-Sharpe-list public
API and stdlib-friendly signatures and delegates the math there.
