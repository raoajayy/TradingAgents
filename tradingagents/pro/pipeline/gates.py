    ``conformal`` is the output of
    ``tradingagents.pro.analytics.conformal.conformal_vol_gate_inputs``:
    a one-step HAR realized-vol forecast with an adaptive-conformal band
    around it. The point forecast is NOT gated — a high but well-understood
    vol is a sizing problem, already handled by VaR and fixed-fractional
    sizing. What this gate consumes is the interval WIDTH: when the band
    blows out, the model cannot say what next-bar vol will be, and stops
    or sizes computed from any point estimate are guesses.

    Behavior (``width`` is a per-bar return fraction; compared as percent
    of price against ``limits.max_vol_interval_width_pct``):

    - cap is None -> disabled, passes (no checks recorded);
    - inputs missing/None (short history) -> passes OPEN, disclosed via
      ``checks["vol_interval_available"] = False`` — a data gap must not
      silently halt trading (same doctrine as the event gate);
    - width <= cap -> passes;
    - width > cap and ``vol_interval_size_scale`` is False -> blocks;
    - width > cap and ``vol_interval_size_scale`` is True -> passes but
      returns a size scale of ``cap / width`` (floor 0.25) that the sizing
      stage multiplies into the position — degrade gracefully instead of
      flapping between full-size and nothing at the threshold.

    Returns ``(result, size_scale)``; ``size_scale`` is 1.0 except in the
    scaled-breach case.
