"""Retro-scorer: close the calibration loop over REAL past decisions.

Every stored run whose recommendation was never taken to a closed trade
(judge said BUY/SELL but the order was gated, venue-refused, or simply
predates execution) still made a falsifiable claim. This module scores
those claims against what price actually did next and writes OUTCOME
records so agent hit rates and the calibration chart accrue.

Honesty invariants (trader review — the calibration chart is "the
product's honesty metric"):
- only REAL recommendations from REAL runs are scored — never a fake or
  replayed LLM decision;
- outcomes are provenance-tagged ``mode: "retro"`` and excluded from the
  trade journal/blotter (they are graded predictions, not trades);
- no lesson records are written (``write_lesson=False``) — lessons are
  reserved for lived trades;
- unresolved tickets (neither stop nor final target hit yet) are skipped,
  not guessed;
- idempotent per recommendation id: re-running backfill never
  double-scores.
