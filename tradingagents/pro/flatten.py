"""Emergency flatten (go-live Phase 4).

The single sanctioned write path from an operator to execution besides
the ordinary gated pipeline: cancel every resting order, close every open
position at market (reduce-only), and disarm all pairs. Shared by the CLI
(`tradingagents-pro flatten`) and the authenticated dashboard control
(`POST /api/flatten`), so both do exactly the same audited thing.

Rationale (documented in DASHBOARD.md): in live trading the ABSENCE of a
one-press stop is more dangerous than its presence. This is the only
dashboard→execution write; everything else stays read-only.
