"""ModelBundle: wire the Phase 0 ModelRouting contract into the pipeline.

Until now a single llm object served all 59 evidence agents and every
pipeline stage (review finding MODEL-01). The bundle routes:
- evidence teams -> quick model (or a per-team override)
- debaters / sentiment -> quick model
- critic / reflection / judge -> deep model

A bare llm passed anywhere is auto-wrapped as a single-model bundle, so
tests and simple callers keep working unchanged.
